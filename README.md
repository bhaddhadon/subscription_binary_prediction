# subscription_binary_prediction

Dataset:
You will be given the public dataset from UCI Machine learning repository about the marketing https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing which is trying to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y)
Questions:
1) Give us your suggestion on how you would make the data better/more useful (E.g. how to do
feature engineering and how features could be enhanced with domain knowledge) and get any actionable business insight for it? 2) With the dataset, could you come up with a scientific approach for analysis/modeling? (e.g.
How you conduct a modeling/design experiment and testing. How to evaluate your work with your chosen dataset. You need to explain why you choose this approach and the evaluation metrics)
